    <p>American coffee consumption had been on the decline for more than a decade when Seattle entrepreneurs Jerry
        Baldwin, Gordon Bowker, and Zev Siegl opened the first Starbucks in Seattle’s Pike Place Market in 1971. By the
        1970s, the country’s major coffee brands were engaged in a bitter price war that forced them to use cheaper
        beans in their blends to reduce costs, resulting in a dramatic decline in the quality of America’s most popular
        coffees. Accompanying this decline in quality was a decline in coffee consumption, which had peaked at 3.1 cups
        per day in 1961. As Americans gradually became disenchanted with the store brands, java enthusiasts–concentrated
        primarily on the West Coast–began experimenting with the finer coffees of Europe that offered richer, fuller
        flavors.</p>

    <p>To harness the potential of the gourmet coffee trend in the Seattle area, the founders of Starbucks experimented
        with the new concept of a store dedicated to selling only the finest whole-bean coffee and coffee brewing
        equipment. At the time, Starbucks coffee was not brewed in-store, but rather by consumers themselves after they
        took the whole beans or grounds home. This emphasis on quality whole-bean coffee retail was fairly unique; only
        a handful of American cities had stores like Starbucks up to that point. Such a store would satisfy the demand
        of Seattle’s gourmet coffee enthusiasts for high-quality coffee products that could previously only be obtained
        through catalogs from companies in Europe. Starbucks also sought to convert Seattleites who had never
        experienced gourmet coffee to break away from traditional brands and integrate the finer European coffee blends
        into their daily lives.

    </p>
    <p>From the start, Starbucks placed quality as its top priority. The Starbucks founders recognized that if they
        wanted to enhance Seattle’s appreciation for fine coffee, they had to provide the best ingredients and brewing
        equipment to ensure that customers had the most enjoyable coffee experiences possible. The Starbucks management
        dedicated a great deal of their time and financial resources to establishing strong relationships with coffee
        growers from around the world. To distinguish their coffee from the bland and tasteless store brands, Starbucks
        only purchased Arabica beans from a carefully selected network of suppliers across the globe; including places
        like Sumatra, Kenya, Ethiopia, and Costa Rica. Arabica beans were selected because the bean’s chemistry could
        withstand high roasting temperatures, resulting in a richer flavor. Starbucks also sought vendors who sold
        products that would protect, and even enhance, the Arabica’s flavor. This required the formation of partnerships
        across the globe with coffee brewing equipment suppliers who provided products that captured the essence of the
        coffee brewing tradition. Simplicity was valued over advanced technology because the machines Europeans and
        others had been using to brew coffee for centuries often proved the most effective in delivering the richest
        flavors.</p>

    <h2>Starbucks Reinvented</h2>
    <br>
    <p>It was not until Howard Schultz, Chairman and Chief Global Strategist of Starbucks, came to the company in 1982
        that a vision for expanding the scope and reach of the Starbucks brand came under serious consideration. Schultz
        realized the powerful business opportunities that lay ahead of the company if he could preserve Starbucks’ core
        values while exposing a wider range of people to the brand. The fledgling company had seen great success in
        converting its small group of loyal Seattle customers into coffee enthusiasts, but Schultz recognized that the
        conservative business plans of early Starbucks management hindered the company from reaching other potential
        coffee lovers. Schultz saw that the next logical step for Starbucks was to begin serving freshly brewed coffee
        by the cup in every store. This realization came to Schultz following a trip to Italy, where he witnessed the
        bustling cafe culture where people stopped to socialize at various points throughout the day, always with a
        fresh cappuccino or espresso in hand. He reasoned that Americans would embrace the concept of consuming fresh
        coffee in a sociable coffeehouse atmosphere.</p>

    <p>Transforming Starbucks from a coffee retailer into a cafe business resulted in several important competitive
        advantages. First, it increased quality control because the coffee was brewed by its own knowledgeable
        employees. Second, Starbucks captured the business of Seattle’s business community who loved high quality
        coffee, but had hectic schedules. Starbucks made enjoying good coffee convenient, thereby enabling the entire
        community to enjoy all the brand had to offer. Lastly, incorporating a coffee service aspect into the business
        differentiated Starbucks from its coffee retail competitors, who were quickly growing in Seattle and in other
        major American cities</p>

    <p>With the coffeehouse model as the primary focus of the company’s retailored business plan, Schultz began to
        concentrate on reshaping Starbucks’ brand identity. As the company entered a period of explosive growth through
        market expansion it needed a reinvented image that captured the elegance of European coffeehouse culture, but
        was familiar enough to appeal to a broad range of Americans. Schultz’s previous coffeehouse, Il Giornale, had
        acquired Starbucks in 1987, but Schultz recognized that keeping the Starbucks name was pivotal to the brand’s
        success. It was already familiar to Seattleites, patrons of the nationwide mail order business and was more
        memorable than Il Giornale. The name was inspired by Starbuck, a deckhand in the classic American novel Moby
        Dick. For this reason, the logo included an image of a mermaid done in a woodcutting style. The Starbucks name
        captured all the aspects of Schultz’s innovative coffeehouse concept; it was bold yet not overwhelming,
        mysterious yet not foreign, and romantic yet not impractical.</p>

    <h2>Creating A Look</h2>
    <p>Starbucks needed to shape the look and feel of the environment of its stores to reflect the synergy of Italian
        elegance and American informality that Schultz envisioned for his unique coffeehouse model. First, the original
        Starbucks logo was updated to appear more contemporary and the color was changed from the original earthen brown
        to the green used by Il Giornale. Next, each of the original Starbucks stores was redesigned so that they echoed
        the romantic atmosphere of Italian coffee bars.</p>

    <p>Rich browns in the wooden fixtures and vibrant green logos on the detailing and packaging formed the primary
        color scheme of Starbucks store design. This palate was selected to represent the company’s emphasis on European
        romance and elegance coupled with casual American warmth. In addition to selling only “best-of-class” coffee,
        Starbucks worked to fill its stores with only the highest quality of everything–from the coffee-making equipment
        to the fixtures and furnishings to the music and artwork. In Schultz’s words, each Starbucks store “is carefully
        designed to enhance the quality of everything the customers see, touch, hear, smell or taste.” Schultz
        envisioned that the Starbucks store would become a “personal treat” for its customers, whether they saw it as a
        convenient stop on the way to work, a refreshing break in their day or a place to relax at night. Starbucks was
        to be, for its clientele, a “Third Place,” a comfortable, sociable gathering spot bridging the workplace and the
        home. Designing a warm, inviting environment was essential to Schultz’s objective of making Starbucks symbolize
        not just a coffeehouse, but a pleasurable coffee-centered experience.</p>

    <h2>Investing Ahead of the Growth Curve</h2>
    <p>This focus on developing creative solutions for solidifying a rich brand identity comple ­mented the Starbucks
        executive team’s philosophy of “investing ahead of the growth curve.”Constant reinvention–critical to developing
        a healthy Starbucks brand–could only be accomplished by making fundamental changes to the structure of Starbucks
        management and by investing in innovation. As Schultz assumed the role of CEO of the new Starbucks, he
        recognized that although he possessed keen entrepreneurial skills and vision to lead Starbucks in this period of
        immense growth and brand redevelopment, he would also need the support of experienced professionals to set his
        vision into motion. Schultz assembled a dynamic management team from some of the country’s most successful and
        innovative corporations such as Nike, Deloitte & Touche, and Macy’s. Each executive joining the Starbucks team
        brought years of experience and fresh creative perspectives.</p>

    <p>Investments in Starbucks infrastructure and process efficiency were equally as crucial to building the brand.
        Schultz’s team of executives identified the need for state-of-the-art facilities (namely roasting and packaging
        plants) that would allow Starbucks to continue producing the highest quality products on a nationwide, and
        eventually a global, scale. In 1989, Starbucks invested in high-speed coffee roaster and packaging equipment
        that would meet the needs of the growing business for at least 10 years. The company later implemented an
        advanced computer information system to keep track of sales across the hundreds of stores that would be opening
        within the first decade of expansion. Between 1990 and 1991 alone, Starbucks raised $18.5 million in venture
        capital to fund this expensive internal development.</p>

    <h2>Innovation to Support Growth of the Brand</h2>
    <p>As Starbucks began focusing on a nationwide growth strategy, the problem of how to protect the freshness and
        flavor of coffee during shipments to distant Starbucks locations became a pressing issue. In the time it took to
        ship fresh roasted beans thousands of miles across the country to store locations in Atlanta or New York, for
        example, the quality of the coffee would decline dramatically. Therefore, significant time and resources were
        invested to develop a vacuum packaging system that prevented harmful air and moisture from seeping into the
        coffee. After the roasting process, coffee would be sealed in “FlavorLock” bags that would remain unopened until
        ready for use in stores. Such an investment allowed Starbucks to preserve its quality, while saving the company
        from the significant costs entailed in building roasting plants in every new Starbucks market. Innovations such
        as the FlavorLock bags highlight the flexibility that Starbucks leveraged in order to adapt to new business
        climates.</p>

    <h2>Starbucks Core Values</h2>
    <p>The new Starbucks management strengthened many of the same core values that the company founders had established
        in the early years and reinvented others to meet the unique challenges it faced as a high growth brand. To
        communicate these core values, a diverse group of employees contributed to the development of the Starbucks
        Mission Statement. In drafting the mission statement, the Starbucks executive team listened to the views of
        employees at all levels and incorporated their beliefs into company policies. Consensus on company values among
        the diverse group of Starbucks employees was imperative for Schultz’s vision of a unified team.</p>

    <h2>Growing the Brand</h2>
    <p>Starbucks also employed a “hub” market strategy where its coffeehouses entered a new market in a clustered group.
        For each new region, a large city would serve as the hub where teams of professionals trained to support new
        stores were located. In the large hub market, the goal would be to rapidly open 20 or more stores within the
        first two years. From the established hub, Starbucks stores then spread to new “spoke” markets. These spoke
        markets consisted of smaller cities and suburban locations with demographics similar to the typical customer
        mix. This deliberate saturation strategy predictably resulted in cannibalization of almost 30 percent of own
        store sales by virtue of the introduction of a near-by store. This drop in revenue was offset, however, by
        efficiencies in marketing and distribution costs, and an enhanced image of convenience.</p>
