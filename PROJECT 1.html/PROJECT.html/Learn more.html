    <h2>STARBUCKS</h2>
    <p>
        Did you know? The Dutch were the first to transport and cultivate coffee commercially…all because they smuggled
        a coffee plant out of the unyielding Arab port in 1690! With this single act of rebellion, they grew coffee in
        large amounts and helped cement a trading center in Amsterdam. They soon became known among the European royals
        for their coffee gifts. One such recipient was Louis XIV who planted and cultivated his “Noble Tree” in the
        royal gardens in 1714. High-spirited and full of flavor, the jovial nature of coffee inspired others to spread
        the joy (even at the risk of rebelling!) While on leave in Paris, a naval officer stole a sprout and transported
        it back to Martinique. This one particular tree is believed to be the father of many Coffea arabica trees alive
        today in the former French colonies of Central and Latin America. In 1727, an opportunity arose when Brazilian
        Lieutenant Colonel Francisco de Melo Palheta was sent to resolve a conflict between the French and Dutch
        colonies in Guiana. Amidst his affair with the wife of French Guiana’s governor, she presented M. Palheta with a
        farewell bouquet where she concealed fertile seeds of coffee. These seeds would turn Brazil into one of the
        world’s largest coffee-producing countries! Coffee now became a drink of the people. This was the first step
        that helped bring coffee to us, to you, and the world. As you sip on your beloved brew in your signature
        Starbucks cup, you appreciate the value of a good cup of coffee — but you don’t always get the opportunity to
        reflect on everything that went into bringing that to you. That’s what we’re hoping to change with this
        mini-series.
